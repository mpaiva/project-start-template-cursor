## üõ†Ô∏è Backend Guidelines

- All APIs must follow **RESTful principles**.
- Use **TypeScript** (if Node.js) or strongly typed languages.
- Validate all input data and sanitize outputs.
- Write self-documenting code; prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Follow standard naming conventions for routes and models.
- Include error handling and appropriate status codes.
- Use environment variables for config/secrets.
- Reference `PRD.md` for feature logic and constraints.
